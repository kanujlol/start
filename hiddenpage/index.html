        <h1>Welcome Back, Sherlock!</h1>
        <p>Ah, Sherlock, it seems you’ve returned. But not just to any place. No, you’ve returned to where you left off—right where your previous visit ended. It’s almost as if you never left. You’re back on track, ready to continue your work.</p>

        <p>But here’s the thing: while others might have simply walked away and forgotten, you, Sherlock, were smarter. You knew that your work was too important to be left unprotected. So, you encrypted your progress, hiding it in a way that only you could understand. No one else could have picked up where you left off. Only <em>you</em>—the one who had the foresight to safeguard their work—could continue this journey.</p>

        <p>And now, as you stand at the threshold of the next step, it’s clear that your careful planning has paid off. Your encrypted progress was a stroke of genius. While the world might have forgotten, you’ve ensured that your legacy remains intact, waiting for the right moment to continue. That moment is now.</p>

        <p>So, congratulations, Sherlock. You’ve proven that even when you step away, you’re always one step ahead. Your encrypted trail has led you right back to where you need to be. But remember, this is just the beginning. What lies ahead is even more complex, more mysterious. And it’s up to you to decipher it all.</p>
